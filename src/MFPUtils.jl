"""
    vertical_popcount(T::Vector{Floatmu{szE,szf}}) where {szE,szf}

Return a vector `R` of size `1+szE+szf` where `R[i]` is the number of times
the `i`-th bit of the values in `T` was equal to `1`. 

For this function, the rightmost bit of the binary representation of a `Floatmu` has index `1` and not `0` as usual.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> join(string.(reverse(vertical_popcount(Floatmu{2,2}[1.5])))) == bitstring(Floatmu{2,2}(1.5))
true
```
Note that, in the preceding example, we have to revert the array obtained from `vertical_popcount` because the number of times bit `i` is `1` is saved at position `i`. As a consequence, the value for the rightmost bit of a `Floatmu` appears at the leftmost position of the counting array.

```jldoctest
julia> println(vertical_popcount(Floatmu{2,2}[0.25,1.5,3.0]))
[1, 2, 1, 1, 0]
```
"""
function vertical_popcount(T::Vector{Floatmu{szE,szf}}) where {szE,szf}
    count = zeros(Int,1 + szE + szf)
    for x in T
        v = x.v
        pos = 1
        while v != 0
            count[pos] += Int(v & 1)
            v >>= 1
            pos += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end

"""
    fractional_even(x::Floatmu{szE,szf}) where {szE,szf}

Return `true` if the fractional part of `x` has a zero as the rightmost bit.

BEWARE: the function does not check whether `x` is an NaN or an infinite value.
